1. Challenge 1:
  - Answer: b
  - Explanation: When the function is called, the variable foo is updated and then printed in the console. Since it was not re-declared inside the function (shadowing), the variable is a reference to the one declared outside the function, not a new one with block scope, so it's the outer one that gets updated. Then, in the global scope, after de function call the console.log prints the updated variable again.
